This is a simple XML-RPC console for OpenNebula. It uses xmlrpc.client (through six) and code.InteractiveInterpreter to provide a simple interface to OpenNebula's XML-RPC interface.

example: >>> one.vmpool.info(-2, -1, -1)
This shows all VMs that the user has VM:USE access to.

The benefit of this over a simple proxy and code.interact is that this injects one_auth and proxy. so that the above can be used instead of:
c.i example: >>> proxy.one.vmpool.info(one_auth, -2, -1, -1)
xmlrpc-c example: $ xmlrpc http://server:2633/RPC2 one.vmpool.info $one_auth i/-2 i/-1 i/-1
Clearly, both are unwieldy compared to this solution.

To use, copy xml_rpc.ini.example to xml_rpc.ini and modify as desired.
